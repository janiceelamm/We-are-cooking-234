## 1.Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## 2.Team Norms and Expectations

### (a)Preparation

* Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class.


* Members who come unprepared agree to accept reasonable consequences determined by the team (e.g., lower peer evaluation scores).


* Before any scheduled team meeting, each member is expected to review the meeting topics (if provided).


* If a member is responsible for presenting a topic, they must come prepared with their talking points, code snippets, or demo.


* Before starting work on a new feature or task, each member commits to pulling the latest version of the main branch to ensure their local environment is up to date.


* Before claiming a task from the project board, each member should read the corresponding Issue or user story to fully understand the requirements.

### (b)Communication

* Primary Channels: Our primary platforms for team communication will be **Discord** for project-related discussions and **Instagram** for quick, informal updates. All official decisions and important information will be documented in our Discord channel.


* Response Time: Each team member agrees to respond to messages within 24 hours on weekdays. We understand that emergencies can happen. If you are unable to respond due to an urgent matter, please notify the team as soon as it is reasonable to do so.


* Proactive Notifications: Team members are required to notify the group in advance about:<br>
  *   Any potential delays in meeting a deadline.
  *   Absences from scheduled team meetings or classes.
  *   Any blockers or issues that are preventing them from making progress on their tasks.


* Code of Conduct: All communication will remain respectful, professional, and constructive. We commit to the following behaviours:
  *   Active Listening: We will listen to understand, not just to reply. We will avoid interrupting others.
  *   Inclusive Participation: We will ensure everyone has an opportunity to speak and contribute their ideas.
  *   Constructive Feedback: When reviewing work or discussing ideas, feedback will be focused on the task or code, not the person. We will be specific and provide suggestions for improvement.

### (c)Attendance & Participation

* All members are expected to attend scheduled team meetings on time. If unable to attend, a member must notify the team in advance via **Discord** or **Instagram**.


* The absent member is responsible for catching up on any missed discussions and decisions.


* During all team activities, every member is expected to actively contribute ideas, ask questions, and engage respectfully in the discussion. We will ensure all voices are heard.

### (d)Decision Making
* Our goal is to make general decisions via consensus (unanimous agreement). If consensus cannot be reached within a reasonable timeframe, a decision will be made by a majority vote.

### (e)Work Quality
* Timeliness & Testing: All assigned tasks are expected to be completed by the agreed-upon deadline. All code must be tested by the author to ensure it functions as expected before a Pull Request is created.


* Git Workflow: All new work must be developed on a separate feature branch. Direct pushes to the `main` branch are not permitted.


* Code Review Process:
    *   Each Pull Request must be reviewed and approved by at least **two** other team members before being merged.
    *   Reviewers are expected to provide constructive feedback within 24 hours of the request.
    *   The author of the PR is responsible for addressing the feedback before the code is merged.

### (f) Environment & Support

* Asking for Help: It is not only acceptable but highly encouraged to ask for help when you are stuck on a problem for more than a hour. We succeed or fail as a team.


* Blameless Culture: We will treat mistakes and bugs as learning opportunities, not as reasons to assign blame. Our focus will be on fixing the problem and improving our process to prevent similar mistakes in the future.

---
## 3.Conflict Resolution
We commit to handling disagreements and conflicts in a constructive and respectful manner. Our process is as follows:

* Direct & Private Discussion: Involved members will first attempt to resolve the issue privately, focusing on the issue, not the person, with kindness and respect.


* Team Mediation: If a private discussion is unsuccessful, the issue will be brought to the entire team for a mediated conversation to find a compromise.


* External Mediation: If the conflict persists, we will collectively seek help from a TA or instructor to act as an impartial mediator.

---

## 4.Accountability

* Each team member is responsible for completing their share of the work in a timely manner and to a high standard.


* If a team member is facing difficulties, they are responsible for proactively seeking assistance from teammates, TAs, or instructors.


* Persistent failure to meet the expectations outlined in this contract may result in lower peer evaluation scores.
